This folder has ESN models file.
esn.py trains the model and handles the hyper-parameters.
ESN.py, ESNcell.py and RRcell.py are the backends of the ESN architecture.
stacked_esn.py trains the model and handles the hyper-parameters.
StackedESN.py, s_ESNcell.py and RRcell.py are the backends of the Stacked ESN architecture.

The ESN model is trained by BackPropagation instead of the usual Moore-Pseudo inverse, as Backpropagation is more flexible while
giving comparable results.
